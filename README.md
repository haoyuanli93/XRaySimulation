# XRaySimulation
This is my new simulation repo.

The reason that I am abandoning the previous repo is that
the previous one is too complicated and contains too much 
information and too many functions.

I need to simplify the repo and make it more maintainable.

In this new repo, there will be no effort made to include 
the simulation of Laue and forward Bragg diffraction at
present. Later in the future, I may include those case,
however.

# To-Do List

1. Add automatic calculation of the electric susceptibility.
2. Add the bragg angle automatically.
3. Add Add Gaussian smoothing to the FWHM function.
